# JAutoGrad
An autograd library for java. It can be used as a building block towards the making and understanding of further machine learning algorithms.



What features should this product give?

1) Allow creation of arbitrarily complex expressions.
	- The types of variables that can exist are
		- Input, given at the time of each computation.
		- Output generated by each computation, are either read or discarded
			- Outputs are not processed further, they are retrieved as is and can be further interpreted by the caller.
		- Desired outputs, provided during the learning stage along with the inputs to calculate error and assist learning.
		- Weights & biases - need to be persisted across restarts
		- Learnings & count of iterations -> temp values to guide learning
2) Serialize expressions to code that can easily compute the required values in a multi threaded manner.
3) Logic to create the network would be to submit number of inputs, outputs, learning method to a network configurer.
